    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this lab is to introduce you to socket programming. \n",
    "You will write a simple chatroom application that allows multiple users to communicate in a single chatroom using server-client architecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lab setup\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will use the same \"docker-compose\" setup as in the previous lab. \n",
    "Refer back to lab2 for instructions on how to setup the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will use the DNS server from lab2 to resolve your domain names. **Make sure that the DNS server is running properly before starting this lab, and that you can use the DNS server of your team's domain name in **client1, client2 and client3** containers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Figure 1](#figure_1) shows the network topology for this lab. You will use the \"webserver\" container as the server for your chat application. Then, you will use the \"client1\", \"client2\" and \"client3\" containers as clients for your chat application. \n",

    "# Milestone 1 -- Chat Room\n",
    "\n",
    "In this milestone, you will write a simple chatroom application with the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "The server application should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Listen for incoming connections on a specified port.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a new client connects, the server should:\n",
    "    - Get the username of the new client and validate it.\n",
    "    - Broadcast a message to other clients informing them that a new client has joined the chatroom.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Listen for incoming messages from any connected client and broadcast those messages to the other connected clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The client application should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Connect to the server application.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Get the username of the client from the user and send it to the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Listen for incoming messages from the server and display them to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Listen for user input and send the input to the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background \n",
    "\n",
    "Before you continue with this lab, we encourage you to get familiar with the basic concepts of object-oriented programming in python. \n",
    "For instance, you could find some of the most fundamental concepts in [Object-Oriented Programming in Python](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, make sure you become familiar with the basic concepts of socket programming. \n",
    "In particular, we suggest you **read pages 184-195 of the textbook** before starting this lab.\n",
    "You can refer to the python [Socket Programming HOWTO](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sockets.html) and [Socket -- Low-level networking interface](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#module-socket) to get an overview of the python socket API and to get **hints to complete the coding tasks** below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some important concepts that are relevant to this lab:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Before sending text over the network, you need to encode it into bytes. \n",
    "Similarly, before displaying text to the user, you need to decode it from bytes. \n",
    "You can use the `encode()` and `decode()` methods of the `str` class to do this. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Figure 2 shows a simple workflow of a client-server architecture using TCP sockets in python. \n",
    "The figure shows the main functions that you need to use to implement the chatroom application. \n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='figure_2'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "|<img src=\"figures/tcp_socket.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" />|\n",
    "|:--:| \n",
    "| *Figure 2: Workflow of client-server interaction using TCP sockets.* |\n",
    "\n",
    "- To handle multiple clients simultaneously, you can create a separate thread for each client. \n",
    "In this lab, however, you will use the [`select()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/select.html) function. \n",
    "The `select()` is a form of [Asynchronous I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_I/O), that takes a list of sockets as input and returns a list of sockets that are ready to be read from. \n",
    "You can use the `select()` function to check if any of the sockets in the list have received data. \n",
    "Additionally, you can use it to check if the user has typed any input. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "  <b>Tip:</b> <b>DON'T</b> skip the readings and get familiar with the links. They are there to help you solve the socket programming tasks and your first lab delivery. \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 1.1 -- IDE Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you will setup an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for editing your python code. \n",
    "You can use any IDE that you like. \n",
    "However, we recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) because it is free, open-source and easy to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "- VSCode is already installed on Sahara's PCs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To use VSCode to edit code on your \"ntnu_server\", you need to install the [Remote-SSH extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh):\n",
    "  - On Sahara's PC, open VSCode and click on the \"Extensions\" icon on the left side of the window.\n",
    "  - Search for \"Remote-SSH\" and install the extension.\n",
    "  - Restart VSCode.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- In VSCode, open the \"Command Palette\" (Ctrl+Shift+P) and select \"Remote-SSH: Connect to Host...\". VSCode should detect the \"ntnu_server\" that you have configured in `~/.ssh/config` (during lab0).\n",
    "\n",
    "- After connecting to the \"ntnu_server\", you can open the \"labs\" folder and start editing your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you got stuck, check out this [tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) for more information on how to use VSCode for remote development.\n",
