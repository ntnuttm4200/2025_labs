    "\n",
    "The server: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Keep track of the clients that are connected to the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Send the list of connected clients to each client when:\n",
    "  - A new client connects to the server.\n",
    "  - A client disconnects from the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "The client:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Send a message to a specific peer using a UDP socket.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "By now, you should be familiar with the basic concepts of object-oriented and socket programming in python. \n",
    "Also, you should use the same IDE setup for editing your python code as in the previous lab. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "- When sending a list (of clients), we need to serialize the list into a string. \n",
    "We can use the `json` module to do that. \n",
    "For example: `json.dumps(list_of_clients)` will serialize the list of clients into a string. \n",
    "On the client side, we can use `json.loads(data)` to deserialize the string into a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the server sends consecutive messages to the client, the client might receive them as a single message. \n",
    "For example, when the server sends the welcome message and the list of clients, the client might receive them as a single message. \n",
    "For simplicity, we use a delay of 0.5 seconds `time.sleep(0.5)` to make sure that the client receives the messages separately. \n",
    "Feel free to explore other solutions, such as:\n",
    "  - Use a line-oriented protocol (each message is terminated by a newline character).\n",
    "  - Use a length-prefixed message format (each message starts with a length field, followed by the message data).\n",
    "  - Use a fixed-length message format (each message has a fixed length, by padding the message with spaces if needed).\n",
